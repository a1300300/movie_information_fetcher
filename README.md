#Introduction
For this project to analyze and predict the performance of the future movieâ€™s office box from the model, we program a small set of API using Python to do data collection mainly from http://the-numbers.com and https://www.wikipedia.org/ and http://www.imdb.com/, as well as data preprocessing.

#Programming Language: Python
Dependency: Python version above 2.7, Anaconda version above 2.5.0.
It is better to include all program files in the same folder for processing

#Execution order:
1. Movie_data_fetch.py
2. Data_to_csv.py
3. Categorization.py	
4. Get_imdb_page.py
5. Get_imdb_plot.py
6. Calculate_text_value.py
